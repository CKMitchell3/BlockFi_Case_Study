# BlockFi Case Study

## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
BlockFi

### When was the company incorporated?
Incorporated in 2017

### Who are the founders of the company?
Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
BlockFi came to be because of the fragmentation of the bitcoin – and really crypto – market in 2017. Bitcoin wasn’t as mainstream then as it is now and although the total market was pretty active, it wasn’t as liquid and lacked the general services that come with traditional institutional banking structures. Since both founders had experience working with large financial institutions, as well as relatively small lending startups, they figured they could use the traditional banking model, combined with the FinTech startup lending model, to create a lane in the crypto space through lending. 

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
BlockFi is a private company that’s already underwent 5 investment rounds with plans of going public soon. To-date, BlockFi has received just under $160M ($158.7M) in funding from large investors such as Fidelity, Winklevoss Capital, Valar Ventures, SoFi, Coinbase, NBA player Matthew Dellavedova and more. 


## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
BlockFi’s initial goal was to solve the dilemma cryptocurrency hodlers’ faced of hodling crypto assets on an exchange, or in a wallet, without it earn anything. If the cryptocurrency didn’t appreciate in value, then it would essentially be the same concept as having fiat sitting in a traditional low-interest bank account. The other issue here for hodlers was in order to grow your crypto asset, assuming that wasn’t it appreciating in value, would require you to sell your asset and invest in another asset class thus creating a taxable event.

Since expanding their services, BlockFi now solves the “peer-to-peer market” dilemma for cryptocurrency hodlers. Before institutional-backed cryptocurrency lending companies entered the crypto arena, hodlers would have trouble borrowing and lending their cryptocurrencies to other hodlers unless there was a prior personal relationship, due to the decentralized nature of crypto. BlockFi solves that issue for both retail and institutional investors because it acts as a market maker for crypto investors, safely connecting borrowers and lenders with no prior relationship while still maintaining the integrity of cryptocurrencies’ decentralized nature.


### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
BlockFi is primarily aimed at retail consumers, small businesses and accredited investors (hedge funds, large banks, insurance companies, etc.). The cryptocurrency lending market is still in its infancy stages, with research and data difficult to obtain, but it has showed extremely promising growth thus far. BlockFi currently has over $8 billion in total client balances (more than 30x assets on platform in 4Q'19) with more than 125,000 funded accounts (12.5x funded accounts in 4Q'19), huge improvements from their 2019 figures. As cryptocurrencies gain in popularity and comfort and more large financial institutions and corporations add it to their balance sheets, retail consumers will ultimately follow suit.


### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Compared to its open-source lending competitors (Maker, Compound, Aave, UniSwap, etc.) BlockFi has an advantage in safety, customer service/user-assistance and familiarity. Open-source cryptocurrency lending firms generally offer high interest rates but they come with a price – their usage of smart contracts has seen bugs and hacks in the past, they don’t offer customer service on their platforms due to the peer-to-peer nature and their financial model is still very unfamiliar to the masses.

Compared to other Digital Asset Lending Platforms (Genesis Capital, Celsius Network, Nexo, etc.), BlockFi offers higher interest-earnings rates on their accounts than their peers and most importantly, offers much more safety. BlockFi doesn’t hold any of their customers’ private keys, rather they keep them with Gemini, an insured custodian. 


### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
BlockFi uses ‘Application and Data’ technologies, ‘DevOps’ technologies and ‘Business Tools’ to run its platform. In specific, it uses the following ‘Application and Data’ technologies – JavaScript, React, NGINX, HTML5, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Amazon EC2, CSS 3 and React Native. It also uses the following ‘DevOps’ technologies – GitHub, Git, Docker and Ansible – and Business Tools – Slack, Jira, Confluence and HubSpot. 





## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
BlockFi is in the Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies domain


### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
A major trend in the Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies domain has been the invention of Crypto Trusts, most notably Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which have opened the door to talks of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency ETFs. Another recent trend has been the entering of major corporations into the cryptocurrency space, most notably companies MicroStrategy, Galaxy Holdings, PayPal, Square, and Tesla. Another recent innovation has been the adoption of the Blockchain Lightning Network, a “second layer” added to the blockchain that enables faster transactions among nodes. This major adoption to exchanges, such as Kraken, is due to the addition of wumbo channels and multi-path payments to the Lightning Network. Another large trend in the cryptocurrency space has been the increased usage of derivatives, mainly with bitcoin. The trading volume of the cryptocurrency derivatives market for the second quarter of 2020 was $2.159 trillion, a 2.57% increase from the previous quarter and a year-on-year increase of 165.56% from the second quarter of 2019. The final major innovation and current trend in the industry has been the continued development of cryptocurrency lending platforms throughout the world. After the first one was created in 2017, crypto lending platforms have continued to gain steam with most of the profit rolling into the companies that have taken a more traditional banking approach to their business model.


### What are the other major companies in this domain?
BlockFi’s main competitors are Genesis Capital, Nexo, Celsius Network and Aave





## Results

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Total Client Assets ($8B), Annual Revenue ($100M), Loans Originated ($5B) and Total Funded Accounts (125,000). There is limited financial data on BlockFi’s competitors because they are private institutions. However, BlockFi is widely considered to be the top crypto lending platform available in the cryptocurrency space so it is performing very well compared to its competitors.








## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
The ability to purchase cryptocurrencies with USD on the BlockFi app/platform and real-time cryptocurrency pricing on the app/platform (I’m sure they’re working on it!)

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Most retail customers that use cryptocurrency exchanges to store their bitcoin appreciate the simplicity that the exchange offers. If BlockFi were to offer these services, essentially becoming one step closer to functioning as a one-stop shop (similar to SoFi, a huge inspiration of BlockFi’s), they would heavily rival popular exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken.
