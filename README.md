# FinTech-Class
All class assignments and projects held here

 My name is Charles Mitchell III and I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. I gradauted from UCF with a B.A. in Finance in 2018 and since then I've been working at a Financial Planning firm in Miami Lakes.

 My career goal is to be great and whatever it is I decide to do.

 I chose FinTech because I love Finance and believe it is necessary to be computer-literate.
